# EEN Android Examples

This project showcases the usage of the Eagle Eye Video API through an Android App.  The code base is primarily java with UI components written in xml. The companion example app can be downloaded at the Google Play Store.

# Getting Started

To run this app, you will need Android Studio which can be downloaded here: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html. Once you have Android Studio and the source code, open Android Studio and select "Import project". Before you can use a physical Android device to run the source code, you must turn on USB debugging on that device. Instructions to do so can be found here: http://www.kingoapp.com/root-tutorials/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-mode-on-android.htm.
